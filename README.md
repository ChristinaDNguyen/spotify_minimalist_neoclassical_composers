# Spotify track feaure analysis : four minimalist, neoclassical composers

## Overview
This repository explores the features of tracks from four contemporary classical and ambient music composers: Ludovico Einaudi, Max Richter, Ã“lafur Arnalds, and Nils Frahm. 
The project pulls data from Spotify's API to analyze key musical features such as tempo, key, acousticness, instrumentalness, and more. The goal is to explore each artist's
distinct musical identities, and find patterns that reveal how they shape their unique soundscapes.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from Spotify's API.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `model` contains fitted models. 
-   `other` contains relevant literature, details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download and clean data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of the CoPilot tool.
